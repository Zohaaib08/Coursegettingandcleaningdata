The run_analysis script performs the following functions in order: 

Step 1: Read files and label data frames with appropriate variable names.
Step 2: Merging the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Step 3: Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Step 4: Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
Step 5: Creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


The repository includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.Rmd'
- 'run_analysis.R' : Contains the script for the above analysis 
- 'Codebook.md' : Contains a thorough description for variables, data, transformations of the tidy data set

The end result is displayed in tidydata2.txt.
